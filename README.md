# Pneumonia-Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying pneumonia from chest X-ray images using a deep learning model. It utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to distinguish between Normal and Pneumonia-infected lungs.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the Chest X-Ray dataset (Kaggle/NIH).<br>
It consists of:<br>
  Normal chest X-ray images.<br>
  Pneumonia-affected chest X-ray images (Bacterial & Viral).<br>
Images are preprocessed and augmented to improve model performance.

## Model
Architecture: CNN-based<br>
Framework: PyTorch<br>
Loss Function: Binary Cross-Entropy<br>
Optimizer: Adam<br>
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix.
